I am Alexandre Gilotte, from the research team at Criteo, where I spent some time working on different metrics to evaluate and improve our recommender system. 
One family of metrics of interest in this context are the so called "importance weighting" metrics, which enable to estimate what would have happened if we had run a modified version of our recommendation system.

While the basic idea of those metrics are quite simple, I could not find an easy-to-read introduction to this topic, presenting both the mathematics and the intuition. This is why I started writing this blog.

Thanks also to David Rohde who helped a lot by discussing and reviewing the present blog.
